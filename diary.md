# Diary of my journey with portfolio project

### Come along as I plan, design, implement, and support software for a massive increase in my online presence

11/27/2022

With my study of object-oriented software design patterns winding down the amount of time I have been thinking about this project has been going way up. I have been researching the portfolio sites of others for design inspiration and doing some research on Gatsby in regards to my options for creating a blog as part of this portfolio site. I will keep this updated with my progress and status. Happy (belated) Thanksgiving to all those who celebrate in the United State.
