# Diary of my journey with portfolio project

### Come along as I plan, design, implement, and support software for a massive increase in my online presence

With my study of object-oriented software development patterns complete I can turn all of my attention to building this portfolio project ... just in time to take a break from side projects until after Christmas. A little break from being constructive in this way is needed to recharge a bit and prepare for the holidays. I have done a lot this year (working to get busy light working with my Raspberry Pi, teaching myself to create and use dev containers, [Angular training](https://github.com/kuehnd96/rocket_hackweek_Q1_2022), and design pattern study) and a little break is needed to get back to things in a week and a half. There is no doubt this project will be on my mind during this break. I am anxioux to get to filling out the ADR file in this repo. Happy holidays! ðŸŽ„

I have been doing some reading about Gatsby this weekend. This looks to be the right level of static content speed, CMS integration, and flexibility to create dynamic HTML that I am looking for. I like how it offers high performance, easy integration with CMS's (for my blog), and the familiarity of React. (I am glad I taught myself some React a few years ago outside of work.) Next up are some technical exercises with Gatsby, Azure static web sites, Contentful, and finding the right way to integrate my blog into the portfolio site.

With my study of object-oriented software design patterns winding down the amount of time I have been thinking about this project has been going way up. I have been researching the portfolio sites of others for design inspiration and doing some research on Gatsby in regards to my options for creating a blog as part of this portfolio site. I will keep this updated with my progress and status. Happy (belated) Thanksgiving to all those who celebrate in the United State.
