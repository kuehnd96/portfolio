# Diary of my journey with portfolio project

### Come along as I plan, design, implement, and support software for a massive increase in my online presence

Happy New Year. After taking some time away from software development outside of work I am ready to get back to it. I am questioning my previous choice of Gatsby (React) and Contentful for this portfolio site. I am now leaning heavily toward .NET Blazor and Azure to create this site and my blog. The reason is I think using the .NET stack and Azure would be more fun and a better use of my time. I don't see myself needing any more React experience in my side projects or my job. The more I think about going in this new technical direction the more my excitement and enthusiasm grows for this project. This would be a great opportunity to level up in the new features, tools, and frameworks of .NET. I have spent the last few years gaining technical breadth outside of .NET outside of work; The idea of gaining technical depth in .NET from this project is too intriguing.

With my study of object-oriented software development patterns complete I can turn all of my attention to building this portfolio project ... just in time to take a break from side projects until after Christmas. A little break from being constructive in this way is needed to recharge a bit and prepare for the holidays. I have done a lot this year (working to get busy light working with my Raspberry Pi, teaching myself to create and use dev containers, [Angular training](https://github.com/kuehnd96/rocket_hackweek_Q1_2022), and design pattern study) and a little break is needed to get back to things in a week and a half. There is no doubt this project will be on my mind during this break. I am anxioux to get to filling out the ADR file in this repo. Happy holidays! ðŸŽ„

I have been doing some reading about Gatsby this weekend. This looks to be the right level of static content speed, CMS integration, and flexibility to create dynamic HTML that I am looking for. I like how it offers high performance, easy integration with CMS's (for my blog), and the familiarity of React. (I am glad I taught myself some React a few years ago outside of work.) Next up are some technical exercises with Gatsby, Azure static web sites, Contentful, and finding the right way to integrate my blog into the portfolio site.

With my study of object-oriented software design patterns winding down the amount of time I have been thinking about this project has been going way up. I have been researching the portfolio sites of others for design inspiration and doing some research on Gatsby in regards to my options for creating a blog as part of this portfolio site. I will keep this updated with my progress and status. Happy (belated) Thanksgiving to all those who celebrate in the United State.
