# Diary of my journey with portfolio project

### Come along as I plan, design, implement, and support software for a massive increase in my online presence

I have been doing some reading about Gatsby this weekend. This looks to be the right level of static content speed, CMS integration, and flexibility to create dynamic HTML that I am looking for. I like how it offers high performance, easy integration with CMS's (for my blog), and the familiarity of React. (I am glad I taught myself some React a few years ago outside of work.) Next up are some technical exercises with Gatsby, Azure static web sites, Contentful, and finding the right way to integrate my blog into the portfolio site.

With my study of object-oriented software design patterns winding down the amount of time I have been thinking about this project has been going way up. I have been researching the portfolio sites of others for design inspiration and doing some research on Gatsby in regards to my options for creating a blog as part of this portfolio site. I will keep this updated with my progress and status. Happy (belated) Thanksgiving to all those who celebrate in the United State.
