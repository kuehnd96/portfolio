# Architecture Decision Report

### This file will contain details of the architecture decisions made for this portfolio project. Text in *italics* indicate decisions that I am noodling on.

## Web Stack

In the several months following the conception of this project I had my mind set on using Gatsby and Typescript as the web technology that would bring this portfolio web site to life. After doing some research on Gatsby and deciding that is was the technology that I needed for the mix of static and dynamic content for this project I started thinking about using .NET instead. The more I thought about this the more one simple thought kept ringing in my head. It was the thought that I like C# and dotnet more than any other tech stack that I have used and that using it on this project was the perfect opportunity to level up in C# and to add the arrow of Blazor to my Microsoft tech stack quiver. The decision to go with .NET instead of Gatsby and Node brought a huge wave of excitement and enthusiasm to this project for me. I still plan on learning Gatsby at some point but I am looking forward to slinging of C#.

The next question is do I create a *webassembly Blazor app or server side Blazor app?*

## Tools
