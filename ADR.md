# Architecture Decision Report

### This file contains details of the architecture decisions made for this portfolio project. Text in *italics* indicate decisions that I am noodling on.

## Web Stack

In the several months following the conception of this project I had my mind set on using Gatsby and Typescript as the web technology that would bring this portfolio web site to life. After doing some research on Gatsby and deciding that is was the technology that I needed for the mix of static and dynamic content for this project I started thinking about using .NET instead. The more I thought about this the more one simple thought kept ringing in my head. It was the thought that I like C# and dotnet more than any other tech stack that I have used and that using it on this project was the perfect opportunity to level up in C# and to add the arrow of Blazor to my Microsoft tech stack quiver. The decision to go with .NET instead of Gatsby and Node brought a huge wave of excitement and enthusiasm to this project for me. I still plan on learning Gatsby at some point but I am looking forward to slinging of C#.

### .NET

After a little research I have decided to use .NET 9 for this project. This is a standard-term support release which means I have 18 months of time before I have to update to the next verson of .NET (10). While this is a shorter window than with .NET 8 I am anxious to get more experience updating .NET apps between major versions. (At the time of this writing I am upgrading a few .NET 6 solutions to .NET 8 at work.)

Another reason for using .NET 9 are some of the new feactures that come with the release. Since this project will involve Blazor I am particularly interested in the constructor injection for Razor components.

### Blazor hosting model

~~After reading a great [resource](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/blazor/hosting-models?view=aspnetcore-7.0&source=docs) on the 3 different hosting models for Blazor I have decided to create this project using the Blazor WebAssembly hosting model. This will sacrifice some performance on initial load and limit my .NET compatibility some. This seems like the way to go since this project will be a relatively thin web site with a lot of static content and I would like it to work when the browser is offline.~~

~~After deciding to store the data for this portfolio in persisted storage to enable generative AI use in the future I had to revisit this hosting model decision. I read [this great resource](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/blazor/hosting-models?view=aspnetcore-7.0&source=docs) again and have decided to go with a server hosting model. The reasons for this is the portfolio site will now need to access persisted storage from another resource over a network. Hitting this resource from a web server instead of the user's browser makes a lot more sense. Plus, the low amount of interactivity with this site will ensure that the traffic on the SignalR connection stays low.~~

A new Blazor hosting model was unveiled this week that I think will be better for this project than the server hosting model. Static server side rendering combmines running a Blazor app on the server while sending changes to the client in the form of HTML chunks. This is the next evolution of the long-standing server-side hosting model that pumped changes to the client using a persistent SignalR connection. This hosting model will perform well due to the low level of interactivity in the Blazor app.

I should give Blazor Hybrid an honorable mention here. This is due to the fact that I would like to enable the use of this portfolio site on native devices (Windows, Mac, iPhone, iPad, and Android) using Microsoft's MAUI technology. Razor components can be hosted this way without change regardless of what hosting model is chosen.

## Tools

### IDE: Rider, VS Code, or Visual Studio?

I have been using Visual Studio since 2002 and I am still a big fan of it. It has everything needed and more for developing this project. It is a bit heavy-handed these days due to how big (resource use, many tools and extensions not needed all the time) it is. 

I have not used Jetbrains Rider yet but have heard great things about it from those who rely on it. I still plan to try it one day but I am not looking to learn a new IDE as part of this project, though.

I have been using VS Code more and more for .NET work in the past few years to see how it compares with Visual Studio for .NET development. I have been liking it due to its low resource use and the reliance on the command line that it comes with.  (I have been enjoying returning to the command line after about 25 years; It reminds me of my days of using DOS for programming.)

I will use a mixture of VS Code and Visual Studio for this project. I will use Visual Studio when using my desktop PC and VS Code when I am using my (low-powered) Surface PC or my Mac.

### CI/CD

I am going to go with Azure DevOps for deployment pipelines with this project since I have more experience with it. I am normally up for using side projects as an opportunity to learn new tools but I think that dance card is already full enough. I still want to learn GitHub issues and projects at some point but I not this time.

### Source Control

GitHub (I ‚ù§ Git)

## CSS

I have a little experience with both Tailwind and Bootstrap. I used Tailwind on a new .NET C# project for a consulting client in 2021. I used Bootstrap for styling the [Angular app](https://github.com/kuehnd96/rocket_hackweek_Q1_2022) I created for the Udemy course I used to level up in Angular in 2022. I liked the experience with Bootstrap more due to the ease of finding the styles I needed and how easy it was to compose markup with the style you want to apply. Bootstrap will be used for this project.

## Cloud Provider

On one had I have been using Azure since 2015 and have a (soon to expire) certification for the platform. I really like Azure and have no big problems with this provider.

On the other hand I have been using AWS since 2021 and use this provider at work. A designed, coded, tested, and deployed my first Lambda function (C#) and really enjoyed the experience due to the tools, testability, and serverless environment. I could always use more experience in AWS since it could help me in my job.

I have been waffling on this decision for weeks now but I have decided to use Azure. I will continue to get more experience in AWS through my job so I will balance the scale with some Azure for this side project. Diagrams are coming soon that will show what Azure offerings will be used; I have been thinking about this and doing a little research.

### Web API Hosting

After some research I am planning to host the API in an Azure Container App. This lines right up with the cloud native serverless approach to this project and it will keep costs low due to the auto-scaling offered with this resource type. I am not expecting a lot of traffic on this site but I still considering this initiative as a lesson in scaling things properly and keeping costs down when it comes to using the cloud. Plus, using Azure Container App comes with the added bonus of upping my docker game with the creation of a production and dev container docker files.

At this point I don't see a risk or downside of going with Azure Container services. This doesn't mean that none exists, though. When I get to deploying my API to the cloud I will update this part of the ADR with any downsides that I find.

## Architecture

After some research I have decided to go with [clean architecture](https://github.com/ardalis/CleanArchitecture) for this project. (Onion architecture is another name for clean architecture.) At the center of my solution is a core project for interfaces, business logic, and model objects. All other projects will depend on this project. Other projects include infrastructure projects which will house different implementations of interfaces and "head" projects which include the API project and web UI project.

I have decided to not use the vertical feature slice arrangement of projects since it leads to large single projects and I would rather keep my projects smaller and separated. (I am not a fan of monoliths but plan to do some research on modular monoliths outside of this initiative.)

Dependency injection will be heavily used and I will keep this ADR up to date on which design patterns I adopt for use.

I decided in late 2024 to build a client SDK for the backend API in C#. On top of being a great technical challenge (even though I have built these before) it will serve as a proof of concept for the usefullness of these client SDK libraries. They wrap everything in a package and shield the invoker of the API from having to mess around with API configurations, URL's, request headers, and everything else that comes with calling an API.
